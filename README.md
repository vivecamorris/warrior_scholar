Most veterans don't graduate. As they adjust from combat to the classroom, veterans often face doubts about whether they belong or have what it takes to succeed. What they need is a mind-set intervention-- a precise, theory-driven, social-psychological intervention that changes how veterans view themselves and unlocks their academic potential. Building off a growing body of research, we want to show veterans returning to college that they belongs and will succeed as warrior-scholars.
